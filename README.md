# ecommerse-backend

A Java Spring Boot REST API for an e-commerce backend.

This project provides a RESTful API for managing products in an e-commerce application. It's built using Java Spring Boot and utilizes H2 as the in-memory database (for development/testing purposes).  The API supports CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on products, along with a search functionality.

## Features

* **CRUD Operations:** Create, Read, Update, and Delete products.
* **Search Functionality:** Search products by keyword.
* **Image Handling:**  Supports uploading and retrieving product images.
* **RESTful API:**  Uses standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for interacting with the API.
* **H2 Database:** Uses H2 in-memory database, suitable for development and testing.  (Consider switching to a persistent database like PostgreSQL or MySQL for production.)
* **Spring Boot:** Built with Spring Boot for ease of development and deployment.
